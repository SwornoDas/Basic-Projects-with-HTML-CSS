# 🌟 Basic Projects with HTML CSS

I worked on some basic **HTML** and **CSS** projects before the lockdown, including a few beautifully styled ones based on Figma designs. I wrote the code for these projects by referring to Figma files, which helped me gain practical knowledge of real-world front-end development scenarios.
